# Traffic Accident Dataset Analysis in Madrid

## Aim of the Project

The primary goal of this project was to analyze and structure a dataset of traffic accidents in Madrid (2024) to uncover key insights about accident patterns, demographics, and contributing factors. The project also aimed to design a semantic web framework to represent this data systematically, enabling interoperability and advanced querying capabilities.

## High-Level Overview

1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Explored accident trends based on weather, vehicle type, demographics, and injury severity.
   - Assessed data quality by identifying missing information and understanding its impact on analysis.

2. **Semantic Web Modeling**:
   - Designed an ontology with resource naming strategies for accidents, locations, districts, participants, and injury severities.
   - Enabled structured representation of accident data for semantic interoperability.

3. **Open Data Contribution**:
   - Aligned the project with Creative Commons BY 4.0 licensing to promote open and reusable data.

This project not only provided actionable insights into traffic accidents but also established a robust foundation for integrating and sharing such data in the semantic web ecosystem.
